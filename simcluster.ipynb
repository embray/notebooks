Our `simcluster.py` module is both an importable Python module (or library), but also acts as a command-line program when executed.\n",

    "1. There's a degree to which, by putting `.py` in the filename, we're exposing how the sausage is made.  Maybe we just want people to be able to make simulated images without knowing or caring what programming language it happened to be implemented in.  We might even change the implementation language in the distant future--or maybe we're writing a replacement for an already existing program.  If we're the only user it doesn't matter so much, but if we want to share our program with colleagues it might be nicer if we just gave them a program called `simcluster` (without the `.py`).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Right now our \"library\" code consists of a single function `simulated_cluster`.  But we've also mentioned that in the future it might grow more components.  Real simulation code might involve dozens of subroutines and utilitiy functions that we might want to break up into separate files.  It might become unmaintainable if we insist that all the code for `simcluster` stay in a single file.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Whether our code consists of a single file, or a bundle of files, we want to be able to install it to a standard location on the operating system.  That way we can run the `simcluster` program just like any other program like `ls` or `grep` or `ds9`.  We also want to be able to `import simcluster` from our Python code just like we `import argparse` or `import astropy`.\n",

    "What we are going to do now is separate our \"library\" code, from the command-line interface, this time by moving them into entirely separate files.  The \"library\" code, currently just consisting of our `simulated_cluster` function can stay where it is in `simcluster.py`.  We will move the `main()` function into a new file called just `simcluster`:"
